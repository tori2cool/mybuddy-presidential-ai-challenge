In the lessons category add a self-paced online school that teaches every subject in the world, from kindergarten basics to advanced college levels and beyond. Instead of traditional grades, use a level system from Level 1 to Level 160, where users earn 50 stars to complete each level (e.g., star 1 to 50 per level, unlocking the next level once all 50 are earned). Users learn at their own pace, tracking progress across subjects.
Key features and structure:

            1. Subject Categories: Organize subjects into categories like Math (subtopics: counting, simple math addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, calculus, etc.), Science (biology, physics, chemistry), Humanities (reading, writing, world history from Earth’s formation to present day, geography), Arts (music, coding, gardening/how to grow plants and make soil), and an “Other” category for anything else. Allow admins to add new subjects or lessons later.
3.  Curriculum Structure: For each subject, divide content into the 160 levels. Each level has 50 stars, earned by completing activities (e.g., quizzes, readings, videos). Use placeholders for content initially—e.g., simple text lessons like “Level 1 Math: Learn basic addition with examples” or embed YouTube links for videos. Make it expandable so I can add real content later.
4.  User Dashboard: After login, show a dashboard with progress bars for each subject (e.g., “Math: Level 3, 2/5 stars”). Users can select a subject, then the level they have completed, and access lessons/activities.
5.  Learning Activities: For each star in a level, include interactive elements like multiple-choice quizzes (generate 1-5 questions per star), reading passages with comprehension questions, or simple coding challenges (using Python embeds if possible). Track completion and award stars automatically.
6.  Progress Tracking: Users advance at their own pace—no time limits. Show a global progress meter (e.g., “Overall Level: 45/160”). Include badges or rewards for completing levels.
7.  Parent Panel portal: A separate section for admins (e.g., me) to add/edit lessons, questions, or new subjects without coding.
8.  UI Design: once you click on a subject Use a clean, modern theme with Streamlit’s components—sidebar for navigation, buttons for actions, progress bars. Make it mobile-friendly. Colors: Blue and green palette for a calming, educational feel; use sans-serif fonts like Arial.
9.  Additional Features: Include search for subjects, daily reminders (optional email integration if easy), and a forum for user discussions (use a simple chat-like interface).
